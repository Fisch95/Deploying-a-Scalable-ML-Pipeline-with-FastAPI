## Model Details
Jason Fischer created the model. It is a logistic regression model using the default hyperparameters in scikit-learn 1.5.1. KFold was used to split the dataset for training and testing (5 splits).
## Intended Use
The model should be used to predict the range of salary an indiviudal will have based on various categorical features. The users are those who analyze census data.
## Training Data
Sample size = 26,049 per fold or 80% of the total data.
## Evaluation Data
Sample size = 6,512 per fold or 20% of the total data.
## Metrics
_Please include the metrics used and your model's performance on those metrics._
Metrics used:
    - Precision
    - Recall
    - F1 score
Performance:
    - P = 0.6212
    - R = 0.3331
    - F1 = 0.4337
## Ethical Considerations
The performance metrics of the model reveal significant ethical implications. With a precision of 0.6212 and a recall of only 0.3331, the model demonstrates a concerning imbalance in its ability to identify positive instances. This low recall suggests that many actual positive cases may be misclassified as negative, which could lead to serious consequences in applications such as healthcare or fraud detection.

The potential for missed positive instances raises concerns about fairness and accountability. If the model is deployed in contexts where certain demographic groups are underrepresented, it may exacerbate existing biases and inequalities. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that the model's limitations are communicated transparently to stakeholders, allowing for informed decision-making.

To address these ethical considerations, we commit to ongoing evaluation and improvement of the model. This includes efforts to collect more representative data, balance precision and recall, and regularly assess the model's performance across different demographic groups. Additionally, guidelines will be established to ensure responsible usage of the model, particularly in high-stakes situations.

## Caveats and Recommendations
Use a stratified k-fold cross validation. This may help improve overall performance if there is any imbalance in representation of any given class.
